## Combatant Tracker
This is meant to be the scaffolding of a combat initiative, missing some functionality like applying an
instance of damage to multiple combatants, editing them at all, and organizing them by initiative count. 
To use this, simply enter the respective information about a creature in the fields on the left, and press
submit. These fields can be cleared by the clear button next to the submit button. On the right will list
the entered creatures, which can be selected by clicking the table rows, and from there deleted with the
button above the table. You can verify which row is selected via the text box above the Delete button,
which will fill with the selected's name. You can clear the selection, or do nothing with the deselect 
and edit buttons respectively. It was laid out using css grids.
